# UTIRnet
Universal Twin Image Revoval Convolutional Neural Network

From https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-1-742

This program is a port of https://github.com/MRogalski96/UTIRnet/tree/main from MATLAB to Python. It trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a training subset of some flowers data https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-, then uses then CNN to test the procedure of removing the twin image from the validation data of the same flowers dataset.
